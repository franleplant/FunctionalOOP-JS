Functional Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript Simple Demonstration.

With a simple inheritance tree with only two classes, the Functional OOP way is demonstrated.
This code is inspired in Douglas Crockford book: "JavaScript: The Good Parts" - Douglas Crockford.


The advantages of using this method are:

-It can be constructed an Inheritance structure without using explicitly the prototype property 
-It can be constructe a simple class with both private methods and atributes and public method and atributes (Thanks to the Closure concept.
-It is much more flexible that the "pseudo classical way" using prototypes and constructors.
